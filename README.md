# Tic-Tac-4

This project was created for fun, and a challenge related to coding a set of JPanels in a grid layout within one JFrame. Another challenge was cleanly coding the logic used to house multiple games in one. 

The players starts with 9 Connect-4 games. 2 Players take turns playing any Connect-4 game they'd like until they tie or win. When a game is finished, the winning color will be displayed in where the Connect-4 game once was. If red wins, a red 'X' is displayed, and if yellow wins then a yellow 'O' is displayed. 

With these wins, the players then try to win the Tic-Tac-Toe game. If a Connect-4 game is tied, it will display as so in the Connect-4 box. If the Tic-Tac-Toe game is tied, a dialog will display as so.
